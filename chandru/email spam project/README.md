# Email Spam Classifier (Classical Machine Learning)

## Project Overview
This project builds a **binary email spam classifier** using classical machine learning algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Naive Bayes

The goal is to classify emails as **Spam** or **Not Spam** using the **SpamBase dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Dataset
- Source: UCI ML Repository – SpamBase Dataset  
- Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase

The dataset is automatically downloaded in the notebook/script.

## Steps Covered
1. Data loading & preprocessing
2. Train-test split
3. Model training
4. Model evaluation
5. Accuracy comparison
6. Confusion Matrix
7. ROC Curve

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python spam_classifier.py
```

Or open `spam_classifier.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.

## Output
- Accuracy scores of all models
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curves for comparison
