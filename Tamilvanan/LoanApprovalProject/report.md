# Loan Approval Prediction - Report

## Objective
Build models to predict loan approval (binary classification) and reach >80% accuracy.

## Models implemented
- DecisionTree
- RandomForest
- XGBoost (optional)
- LightGBM (optional)
- CatBoost (optional)

## Usage
See README.md for instructions.

## Results (example)
Run the training script on the real dataset to obtain model accuracies, confusion matrices and feature importance charts.

## Notes
- Feature importances are saved in `outputs/plots/`.
- Trained models are saved in `outputs/models/`.
