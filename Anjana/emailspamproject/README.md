# Email Spam Classifier

This project builds a binary classifier to detect spam emails using classical Machine Learning algorithms.

## Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
- Naive Bayes

## Dataset
- SpamBase Dataset (UCI ML Repository)
- Loaded programmatically via OpenML

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report
- ROC Curve and AUC

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python spam_classifier.py
```

## Output
- Accuracy comparison of all models
- Confusion matrices
- ROC curve plot
