# Loan Approval Prediction (Ensemble Models)

## Project Description
This project predicts whether a loan should be approved using Decision Trees and Ensemble ML models:
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- LightGBM
- CatBoost

## Dataset
Loan Prediction Dataset (Kaggle):
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication

Download `loan_data.csv` from Kaggle and place it inside the `data/` folder.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the training script:
   python src/train_models.py

## Output
- Model accuracy comparison
- Feature importance charts
- Best model with >80% accuracy
