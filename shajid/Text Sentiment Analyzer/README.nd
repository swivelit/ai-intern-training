# 📌 Text Sentiment Analyzer using LSTM & GRU (RNN)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project implements a **Text Sentiment Analysis system** using **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**, specifically **LSTM** and **GRU**, to classify movie reviews as **Positive** or **Negative**.

The model is trained on the **IMDb Movie Reviews dataset** provided by Keras.  
A comparison is made between **LSTM and GRU models** based on accuracy and performance.  
The project also includes a **text demo script** to predict sentiment for custom input sentences.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build sentiment classification models using **LSTM** and **GRU**
- Train and evaluate both models on IMDb dataset
- Compare accuracy and performance
- Save trained models
- Predict sentiment for custom user input text

---

## 📂 Dataset
- **IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset**
- Source: Keras built-in dataset
- Total samples: **50,000**
  - Training: 25,000
  - Testing: 25,000
- Labels:
  - `1` → Positive review
  - `0` → Negative review

## 🧠 Models Used
### 1️⃣ LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Handles long-term dependencies in text
- Slightly higher accuracy
- More parameters compared to GRU

### 2️⃣ GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit)
- Lightweight version of LSTM
- Faster training
- Fewer parameters

---

## 🧱 Model Architecture
Each model consists of:
- **Embedding Layer** (word representation)
- **LSTM / GRU Layer**
- **Dense Output Layer** with sigmoid activation

---

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python **3.9 / 3.10**
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
