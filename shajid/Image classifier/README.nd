# FAST Image Classification using ResNet50 (CIFAR-10)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **fast image classification** on the **CIFAR-10 dataset** using **Transfer Learning with ResNet50**.  
The model leverages a **pretrained ImageNet ResNet50 backbone**, adds a **lightweight custom classification head**, and uses an **optimized tf.data pipeline** for faster training.

The design goal is to achieve **good accuracy within 30–60 minutes on GPU** while keeping the model efficient.
