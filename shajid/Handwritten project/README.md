# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN (MNIST)

## Project Overview
This project implements a **plain Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten digits (0–9) using the **MNIST dataset**.

## Dataset
- MNIST (built-in Keras dataset)
- 60,000 training images
- 10,000 test images
- Image size: 28x28 (grayscale)

## Expected Output (Satisfied)
✔ Basic CNN built  
✔ >98% accuracy  
✔ Visualization of filters & activations  
✔ Model training & evaluation  

## Requirements
```
pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
```

## How to Run
```
python train_cnn.py
```

## Output
- Training & validation accuracy
- Test accuracy (>98%)
- CNN filter visualization
- Feature map (activation) visualization
